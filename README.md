# CIT Code Portfolio

A requirement of this project was to create a GitHub User Page to serve as an online portfolio of our coding projects. The page then links out to other published project pages that we made.

### Markdown

As part of the project, we deployed our page to GitHub.

[Here is the page running on Github](https://isabella-garcia.github.io/)
